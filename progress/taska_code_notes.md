# Analysis of the entire code base (know wtf is happening in each step)
This is just for my own take and attempt in learning all of the TASKA code. 
This is basically what I will be doing if I cannot go to lab and work directly with the TASKA itself.
- A class of TASKA is created (link for class tutorials is here https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html).
- Everything inside TASKA is done for python implementation of a TASKA prosthetic hand driver using bluetooth
- Static method (https://stackabuse.com/pythons-classmethod-and-staticmethod-explained/)
