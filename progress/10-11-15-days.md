# Oct 11th to 15th days
- Worked a lot with Tina and tested the glide software to get it to work on the TASKA and active wrist. 
- Was able to get more info on what is right/wrong and how the glide/TASKA grip library works.
- A full tutorial/writeup is posted now that displays how to set up the glide as well as instructions and guidelines that should be followed to get it to work
- Switching back over to the positional control re run and set up the TASKA code
