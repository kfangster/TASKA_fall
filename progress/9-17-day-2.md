# Day 2 September 17 2021
- The low profile wrist has been charged and prepped to have the TASKA hand attached to it
- The TASKA code was worked on today to make sure that it actually worked
- One of the things changed in the TASKA og code is the 'from . import AbstractBaseOutput' commented and the AbstractBaseOutput deleted from the class TASKA(AbstractBaseOutput):
 - The reason for deleting the AbstractBaseOutput is because it is from an experimental library from IBT that is not needed
- Another edit to the TASKA og code was changing the mac address to the TASKA hand
- Another edit to the TASKA og code was changing getargspec to getargfullspec due to deprecation
