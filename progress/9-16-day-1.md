# Day 1 September 16, 2021
- Had meeting with Becca and Dayeon about their conference paper and attempt to reach out to Dayeon if need help in unity
- played around with the TASKA and downloaded things needed to use TASKA bluetooth (PORT Com3)
- low profile wrist out of battery need battery to play with TASKA
- maybe take apart low profile wrist and put in the TASKA battery and power system to try it out?
- to run code just use vss and it'll automatically run on the TASKA if connected via bluetooth
