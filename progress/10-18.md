# October 18th
- Reran the TASKA code using the low profile wrist to ensure that the bluetooth code works
- Try to use the bebionic3 code on the active wrist and TASKA see what happens maybe?
- No access to the active wrist until Thursday (Friday for me)
- Continue to do unity tutorials for the hololens to familiarize oneself to it. Try to get hands on hololens Wednesday maybe?
