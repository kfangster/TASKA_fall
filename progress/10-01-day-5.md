- Got the glide to work, troubleshooted with Becca on the reasons as to why there was no discrete control and only had 2 sites
- Turns out to be there aren't enough electrodes and the wrist has issues too
- Got an active wrist with 8 electrodes and attempting to test it now to see if the Glide software works on this.
